Title: Robert's Responsive Portfolio

The reason for this portfolio is to show case my learning progress over the last week and a hlaf. I created this website as my first portfolio and to practice my code writing skills. 2 weeks ago I didn’t know how to write any code or any of the languages to do so. In this assignment I created 3 different html’s using mainly bootstrap and one css stylesheet. I also made sure that my portfolio is mobile responsive so it can be read across multiple devices.
